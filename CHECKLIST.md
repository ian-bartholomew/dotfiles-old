# CHECKLIST

Scripting out installing all the packages need, and the upkeep is more than i want to do for this project.  And installing each by hand in a clean install is probably better in the long run anyways.  So here is a checklist of things to install:

- [ ] nvim
- [ ] zsh
- [ ] shellcheck
- [ ] tig
- [ ] curl
- [ ] tmux
- [ ] docker
- [ ] aws-cli
- [ ] terraform
- [ ] terraform-ls
- [ ] aws-vault
- [ ] asdf
